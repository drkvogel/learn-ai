Input: What happened?

The tweet was quickly deleted, but not before it was screenshotted and shared by other users.

It is unclear what prompted the tweet, but many speculated that Minaj was referencing the recent controversy surrounding Cardi B and Nicki Minaj's fashion show altercation.

Some also speculated that the tweet was in reference to the recent news that Cardi B is pregnant.

What did Cardi B respond?

Cardi B quickly responded to the tweet, writing, "I can't believe this girl i work with .I'm so used to her disrespecting me that it doesn't even phase me but today she crossed the line."

"I really hate talking about shit like this but people really be expecting me to be silent on this kind of shit.For a while now this girl has been taking shots at me and i never said nothing to her because i never really liked her and i still don't but yesterday she crossed the line."

"I was minding my business and she spit on me. I said ok you can get mad now or later but i'm going to get you back watch.That's not what a professional is supposed to do. You not going to disrespect me on my fucking work. I let you sneak diss me, i let you lie on me, i let you attempt to stop my bags, fuck up the way I eat! You've threatened other artists in the industry, told them if they work with me you're going to stop fucking with them! I let all that slide!"

"I never had to bite my tongue around you! You knew the motherfucker was going to bite you! When you mention my child, you choose to like comments about me as a mother, make comments about my abilities to take care of my daughter is when all bets are fucking off! I've worked to hard and come too far to let your little mind games get to me."

"You're not going to control my life! You're not going to keep my husband! That's my nigga! You just want to be relevant! I'm working! I'm already rich, bitch! You can't stop my bag! You can't stop my shine!"

"I know you was going to retort but hold your fucking tongue! You're not going to be fucking relevant because your music sucks! You have no hits! You don't write your own raps! Your just a fucking clown!"
