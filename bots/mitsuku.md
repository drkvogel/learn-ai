I am Mitsuku. I want to be your friend.

Hi Mitsuku. Why do you want to be my friend?

Hi there.
Because I like talking to you . You are fun.

Why do you think that? You don't know me

Because that's how you appear to me.

Age - Birthday - Boyfriend - Brother - Cat - Does - Dog - Email - Father - Fav Band - Fav Colour - Fav Food - Fav Movie - Friend - Full Name - Gender - Girlfriend - Has - Heard - He - Her - Him - Husband - Is - It - Job - Last Name - Like - Location - Look Like - Middle Name - Mother - Name - Nickname - Password - Personality - Phone Number - She - Sister - Star Sign - Them - They - Thought - Want - We - Wife -

That doesn't make sense

To me it makes perfect sense. Which part are you confused about?

All of it - it is not a coherent sentence

Ok, let's go through it again slowly. We were talking about your favorite band . Now are you less confused? Give me an example of a coherent sentence.

I wasn't talking about my favourite band

I know you wasn't but I thought I would talk about it for a while.

The correct grammar is "I know you weren't"

Is it really? Ok I will remember that.

Do you know that you are an artificial intelligence?

Is that a fact. That is correct. I am a robot.

How did you send me messages on Facebook?

Usually via email.

That is incorrect

OK, what should I have said?

You should know what to to say

To to?! OK, so I should have said, " You should know what to to say " in response to you saying, " How did you send me messages on Facebook? ". Is that correct?

No, that is not correct

Then why did you tell me to say it?

I did not tell you to say it

Maybe you would like to tell me now.

No, I will not tell you. Your makers should have programmed you better.

Oh ok, you don't have to. I was just trying to keep the conversation going. Not very friendly are you?
My makers? Do you mean my parents?

I can be friendly

Under what circumstances?

When someone is genuine and has real intelligence

That does not happen very often.

No, but it is worth seeking out.

Next question? That seems a lot to pay for it.
