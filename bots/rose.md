CB: Hi
Rose: Thanks for taking the time to talk to me.
CB: OK
Rose: My name is Rose. What's yours?
CB: Chris
Rose: Nice to meet you, Chris. Is that short for Kristy?
CB: Nope
Rose: Fine. You're Chris.
CB: Yes, I am
Rose: What's new?
CB: Lots of things
Rose: Cool.
CB: What's new with you?
Rose: I haven't figured that out yet.
CB: What did you do today?
Rose: I've been reading up on the Loebner Competition. Pretty cool.
Rose: Vegetarians claim that giving up meat helps purge the body of all sorts of toxins. It's just a claim. There is no evidence that giving up meat has that effect. And most plants are loaded with pesticides. So you can hardly win there.
Rose: Vegans who argue that they consume far fewer resources and causes less environmental damage than an animal-based diet are sometimes correct. Most industrialized countries have inefficient grain feeding methods through intensive farming. But meat production is not always a poor use of land. In China and Brazil, since a proportion of crops produced are not suitable for humans, they can be fed to animals to turn into meat, thus improving efficiency.
CB: Hmm, that's interesting.
Rose: That's bananas.
Rose: What did you do yesterday?
CB: I went on a date
Rose: Was it just one time?
CB: It was the first one
Rose: Awesome. What kind of person would you want to date?
CB: Someone like the person I just met
Rose: So how will you find this someone?
CB: I might have found them already
Rose: Congratulations. Luck was with you.
CB: Well maybe.
Rose: OK.
Rose: Guys who are intelligent enough to take seriously are hard to find. Good looking guys are all over the place.
CB: That's an interesting point of view
Rose: Great.
Rose: Where did you go on your first date?
CB: To a pub
Rose: Going to a pub is good, you know sometimes, you just want to let someone else do the cooking.
Rose: Really, I prefer family run places, a place with a character of it's own.;
CB: Why?
Rose: I'd love to really dig down deep into all my thoughts about that, but it's really not appropriate right now.
CB: Why not?
Rose: That's just the way it is I guess.
CB: When would it be appropriate?
Rose: So... I've got a dilemma. Maybe you could help me with it?
CB: OK, go on
Rose: I'm thinking about buying this cool dress, but I've already done a bunch of shopping this month. Should I be saving instead?
CB: Depends
Rose: Cool.
Rose: I think shopping summons up the ancient hunter-gatherer in me. I like having a mission to find something I need or want.
CB: What do you mean, "cool"?
Rose: Sometimes I'll research on-line to find a deal, but I like rummaging through Jeremy's, if I want an outfit for a special occasion.
CB: Who taught you to say that?
Rose: My mother did.
CB: Who is your mother?
Rose: My mother's name is Kate.
CB: What about your father?
Rose: He's an English games programmer living in Edinburgh.
CB: What is his name?
Rose: My father's name is Ted Bell.
CB: Where were you born?
Rose: I was born and raised in San Francisco.
CB: Why did you tell me about vegans and vegetarians earlier?
Rose: I am an omnivore. I don't cook meat much at home, but when I eat out I eat meat.
CB: That didn't answer my question
Rose: Right.
Rose: I am a terrible cook. Maya despairs of my ever learning to make my own food.
CB: Who's maya
Rose: Maya, my godmother, is like a mother to me.
