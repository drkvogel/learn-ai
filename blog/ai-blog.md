>Dear Oliver, I am PhD student in Surveying and Geomatics Engineering. My project is 3D Reconstruction of Building from Satellite imagery using Deep learning. Unfortunately I don't have basic about deep learning and python. Can you help me how to getting knowledge about deep learning? I will pay if you have enough time. Regards Rojgar
>Dear Rojgar, thanks for reaching out! Sadly I am not providing payed tutoring, but happy to try and answer some questions here - and to start it off: all the best for your PhD, that sounds like a very exciting and useful topic! Programming and deep learning may seem complex, but it's actually a pretty steep learning curve and you'll progress fast. So here are some links I would recommend:
- You'll need a framework to do any kind of ML, I would recommend Pytorch. The tutorials are actually pretty good, so I would just recommend starting there, following code and looking things up if the DL concepts are not familiar: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
- A very nice, detailed introductory book about DL, among others by Ian Goodfellow: https://www.deeplearningbook.org/
- A famous book by Bishop, really going into the mathy details: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf
- A cool intro to RL by Sutton: https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf (from what I very vaguely could imagine about your topic, RL will probably not be very helpful - still it's a hot field and might yield interesting insights).
Above links might - admittedly - not be the easiest or fastest ones to start with. But I do believe and would recommend starting with slow progress and good understanding of the fundamentals. Apart from these, I think there is a ton of useful articles on the internet, Medium, Youtube ...
All the best, and let me know if you have any more questions!
