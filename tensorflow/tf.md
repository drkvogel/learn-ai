Python 2.7, not 3.6, is the default? [Any reason why Python 2.7 (not 3.x) is the default version for machine learning?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/641kpf/d_any_reason_why_python_27_not_3x_is_the_default/)


## Transfer Learning

transfer learning means we start with a model that has been already trained on another problem. We  then retrain it on a similar problem. Deep learning from scratch can take days, but transfer learning can be done in short order.
